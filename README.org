Helm interface to tree-sitter

Currently supported languages: C/C++, Python and Rust. Adding support for additional languages should be trivial. PRs are very much welcome!

Usage:
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'helm-tree-sitter)
(helm-tree-sitter-or-imenu)
;; or
(helm-tree-sitter)

#+end_src

A debug utility, which simply lists all available nodes in the existing tree-sitter tree is also provided:
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'helm-tree-sitter-debug)
(helm-tree-sitter-debug)
#+end_src
